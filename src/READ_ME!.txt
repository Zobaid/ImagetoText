1) main.py runs with manual word segmentation and use only NN model for text recognition
2) main_pytess runs with pytesseract and NN neural model.
Instructions
1) Give one image at a time in input_word directory and run script.(main.py or main_pytess.py)
2) Delete created output file if needed to rerun.
Additional
1) Code speed can be optimised and code can be refactor to read more than one image at a time
