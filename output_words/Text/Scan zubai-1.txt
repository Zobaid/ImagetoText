we have a dataset of roilrs holding an A4 paper in font 

& profile sides - We also have a conresponding pictures that are 

annotated #ily \andmarleing- The annotations are to mark 

the points off arm shoulder waistichest 8bicep . Both af these 
datasets are m jRo png format 
The over goal is te automate the landmark points on the 
take of a Customer holdmg an A4 paper 
Second goal is to automate how measurements needed loaded 
on the automated \andmariciny done previously - 

re 

My original task is to play around with Dofectron2- thats the 

recommended tool well use for our object detection- 

This is the flow of using the Detectron First Vi need to 

register the dataset go it can be used mM Defectront not is 

to tramn the registered dataset usm a model built in Detectront 

Then well evaluate the models purtormannge & lastly 1 

Visualize our trained Gninia datasets Bae a she further by 

using a newlys taken picture of someone holdny an AY paper 

| see if the \anolmarding is the same as we expected . 

8 registry our custom dataset there are two ways to do 
haig For & normal datasetfke ! tie we currently have), lI need 
totransform ir WHO a list of dictronanips 
Tiese dictionavies will cottam information of each mage 
The main keywords needed for registening dataset in 
derectnonc are :
